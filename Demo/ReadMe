Demo of IT Infrastructure monitoring and analytics solution built on ActionVector IoT Platform. 
The data collector collects CPU, disk and memory metrics on the machine where you execute and publishes the events to the server. 
The event stream is processed by CEP Engine and cpatured in event repository. 
The Analytics framework generates various multi-dimensional performance charts that can be viewed in the dashbaord application. 

You can see the source code for this referece implementation in the source code repository.
