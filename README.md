The ActionVector-IoT Platform, built on Java technologies, is a scaleable, secure and robust platform for developing IoT Applications and Solutions. The platform is organized as a set of service frameworks that can be configured, customized or even extended to meet your needs.
ActionVector-IoT is licensed under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache 2.0 License</a>

The Platform comprises of a set of Common Applications and Services (CAS) Frameworks that encapsulate common, generic, core foundation services that  every IoT application requires and, Domain Applications and Services (DAS) Frameworks that encapsulate services specific to the application domain such as smart city, smart energy, smart data center or services specific to devices or standards applicable across domains. This separation enables independent evolution of the core technical platform and domain or application specific frameworks.

The platform includes a reference implementation of the DAS for Solar Plant Monitoring and Analytics Solution and IT Infrastructure Monitoring and Analytics Solution. These reference implementations clearly brings out the the overall structure of an IoT application in terms of CAS and DAS frameworks and reinforces the common design principles such as encapsulation, extensibility and loose coupling. Downloadable demo as well as the source code for these reference implementations are available in this repository.

The Service Frameworks are highly configurable and can also be easily customized to your needs. you may replace a service framework with your own implementation complying to the APIs. For example, the ActionVector-IoT supports the stream analytics via Esper engine (www.espertech.com). You may integrate your own CEP engine or other frameworks.
